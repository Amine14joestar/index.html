        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>1. What is Designers Without Borders?</h3>
            <p>Designers Without Borders is a platform where designers can upload and sell their digital artwork,
                designs,
                and other creative works. It's a space for designers to showcase their talent and potentially earn money
                from their designs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>2. How can I upload my designs to the website?</h3>
            <p>To upload your designs, simply create an account, log in, and follow the instructions under the “Upload”
                section. You'll be able to upload your work in various formats like PNG, JPEG, or PDF.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>3. Do I need to pay any fees to sell my designs?</h3>
            <p>No, there are no upfront fees to upload your designs. However, a small commission will be taken from each
                sale to help support the platform.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>4. What types of designs can I upload?</h3>
            <p>You can upload any digital design, such as illustrations, logos, posters, digital art, social media
                templates, website designs, and more. The designs must be original and created by you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>5. What file formats can I upload?</h3>
            <p>You can upload PNG, JPG, PDF, and other common image formats. Please make sure your files are not too
                large
                to ensure smooth uploading.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>6. How do I set a price for my designs?</h3>
            <p>You can set your own price for your work. Keep in mind that while higher prices may yield more profit,
                pricing too high might limit the number of buyers. We suggest doing some research on similar products to
                find a competitive price.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>7. Can I sell multiple designs at once?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can upload and sell as many designs as you'd like, but each one needs to be uploaded separately.
                Each design will have its own page where customers can view and purchase it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>8. How will I get paid for my sales?</h3>
            <p>Payments will be processed through PayPal. After each sale, you will receive your payment minus a small
                commission.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>9. How long does it take for my design to appear on the site after uploading?</h3>
            <p>Once you've uploaded and submitted your design, it will be reviewed by our team. After approval, your
                design
                will appear on the site within 24-48 hours.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>10. How do I promote my designs?</h3>
            <p>You can promote your designs by sharing your profile and design links on social media, email, and
                personal
                blogs. We also encourage you to use hashtags related to design on platforms like Instagram or Twitter.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>11. What if I don't have a PayPal account?</h3>
            <p>PayPal is our preferred payment method, but if you don't have an account, we encourage you to set one up.
                It's free, easy, and widely used for online transactions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>12. Can I offer discounts or promotions for my designs?</h3>
            <p>Yes! You can offer discounts and promotional codes during special events or holidays. Just be sure to
                clearly
                communicate any discount offers to potential buyers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>13. What happens if my design is copied or stolen?</h3>
            <p>We take copyright issues seriously. If you believe someone has copied or stolen your design, please
                report it
                immediately to our support team. We will investigate the issue and take appropriate action.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>14. Can I remove a design from the site if I change my mind?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can delete your designs from the platform at any time. However, if a design has already been
                purchased, it will remain available for the buyer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>15. Can I collaborate with other designers on projects?</h3>
            <p>Yes, collaborations are welcome! You can upload collaborative work with proper credits. Just make sure
                both
                parties agree on the terms, including how any sales will be split.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>16. What should I do if I have technical issues with uploading or selling my designs?</h3>
            <p>If you encounter any technical problems, please contact our support team through the "Contact Us" page.
                We're
                here to help and resolve any issues as quickly as possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>17. Are there any guidelines for the content of my designs?</h3>
            <p>All designs must be appropriate and follow the community guidelines. We do not accept offensive,
                discriminatory, or illegal content. Please ensure your work aligns with our ethical standards.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>18. How can I track my sales and earnings?</h3>
            <p>You can view your sales and earnings through your account dashboard. This will show you how many designs
                have
                sold and how much you've earned so far.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>19. Can I edit my design after it's uploaded?</h3>
            <p>Once a design is uploaded and listed, you can edit the title, description, and price. However, the file
                itself cannot be edited directly; if you want to change the design, you'll need to upload a new version.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>20. How do I know if my design is selling well?</h3>
            <p>You can check the number of views and sales on each design's individual page. The more views and positive
                feedback your design gets, the more likely it is to be purchased.</p>
